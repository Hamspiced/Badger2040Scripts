# Badger2040Scripts
Badge.py can replace the original examples/Badge.py file.

Allows you to have multiple badges that can cycle with the up and down arrows.   Badges can be saved as txt files but must be labled badge1.txt, badge2.txt, badge3.txt

Everything in the badge file should be the same 7 lines as the stock example.  Last line should refference the JPG image which should be 104x128 pixels.

Obviously this will only work as long as the badger2040 has power.
